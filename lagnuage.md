# Outline of initial part. The language aid. 

We have the base of the lesson which is the textbook. Student and Teacher should both have visibility and control over which part of the textbook one is learning. So the first part to build will be loading the textbooks, and customizing what the student and teacher must see. 

1. Textbook viewer 
    Must separate by chapters and feed the whole chapter to the teacher, the student must also have access. 

2. Lesson
    Once said chapter is selected and the lesson commenced, the teacher must first present the contents of the lesson, then make sure they are learned, providing explanations and specificity when solicited by the student. Whenever the student is ready to advance to the next lesson, the teacher must make sure that the student comprehends it sufficiently. 

3. Memory and reflecting on the lessons
    The teacher must have access to the past work done by the student, the student's doubts, what the student has previously learned and struggled with. Also, the teacher should analyze how the student has evolved and the skill level over time so it too can adapt.
